  ArUco marker detection implemented in **C++ with OpenCV**.  
  Includes a **Qt-based GUI** for visualization, demonstrating integration of computer vision and UI.  

- **[Lane_Detection_CPP_ROS](https://github.com/chrissunny94/Lane_Detection_CPP_ROS)**  
  Lane detection pipeline in **C++ and ROS**.  
  Designed for **real-time robotics** applications with modular ROS node structure.  

---

## 🐧 Linux / Build Systems

- Daily development on **Ubuntu/Linux** with ROS, OpenCV, and CV toolchains.  
- Experienced with **CMake** for complex C++ projects and **Docker** for containerized development.  
- Debugging using **gdb, valgrind, perf**, and automation with **Bash scripts**.

## 🤖 ROS, SLAM & Navigation

- **[t265_robot_navigation](https://github.com/chrissunny94/t265_robot_navigation)**  
  Navigation stack using **Intel RealSense T265** for **visual-inertial odometry**.  
  Integrated with ROS navigation (**move_base, path planning**).  

- **[mono_vo_ros](https://github.com/chrissunny94/mono_vo_ros)**  
  Monocular visual odometry in ROS using **feature extraction, tracking, and pose estimation**.  
  Hands-on experience with **camera models and SLAM fundamentals**.  

- **[follow_waypoints](https://github.com/chrissunny94/follow_waypoints)**  
  Contributed a **PR that got merged** for autonomous waypoint navigation in ROS.  
  - Buffers `move_base` goals and sequentially navigates through them.  
  - Enables robots to follow a series of waypoints autonomously.  
  - Practical for **patrol, inspection, or delivery robot applications**.
